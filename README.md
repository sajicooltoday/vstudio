my games website. written in better css and html. uses vercel/replit and ultraviolet proxy for the websites proxy feature.
the whole goal is to not pay a single penny, thats why the backend is ran on replit/vercel.
soon i will most likely start paying for hostin so i can put more stuff, and adding ads, while still keeping the project open source. ik you will
just be able to fork and remove ads but they are not vide ads just stuff on the side.

WEBSITE COMPLETION: ❌  
PAID HOSTING: ❌  
ADS: ❌
