my games website. written in better css and html. uses vercel/replit and ultraviolet proxy for the websites proxy feature.
the whole goal is to not pay a single penny, thats why the backend is ran on replit/vercel.
soon i will most likely start paying for hostin so i can put more stuff, and adding ads, while still keeping the project open source.
